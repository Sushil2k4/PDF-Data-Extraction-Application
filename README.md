# PDF-Data-Extraction-Application
A Python-based application that extracts data from customer-filled PDF forms, converts the extracted data into structured formats such as Excel or CSV, and handles images within the PDF. This project was developed as part of a hackathon to solve a real-world problem.

## Features:

Accurately extracts text and selection marks from PDF forms
Identifies and interprets tick marks, cross marks, and shaded boxes to determine selected options
Handles and processes images within the PDF using OCR technology
Converts extracted data into structured formats such as Excel or CSV
Supports multi-language text extraction and processing

## Technologies Used:

Python 3.x
PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction
Pillow and OpenCV for image processing
pytesseract for OCR
pandas for data manipulation and conversion to Excel/CSV
